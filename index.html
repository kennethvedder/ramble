		<div>Smile at the door, walk in, let your eyes wander, found her. I only see her blonde hair, she’s slouching weirdly today, I grab her shoulder, she says my name as she always does and smiles, there’s a spot ready for me; I smile, kiss her cheek, smell her, leave my jacket in the chair, go to the bathroom, check my hair, smile, go back.

		<div>Bring me your lips, shine your teeth upon me. You have no idea how I've longed for your cigarette-scented kisses. Your touch on my face haunts me. No longer can I hold in my desire to hear your laugh, to have my arm surround your collarbones as I pull you in. Bring me your sincerity and your issues. Bring me some damn rest.
</div>
		<div></div>

		<div>Smothered. Oh my fucking god, this is no longer bearable. I can’t take it anymore. My hands don’t know what to do. My body shivers. My locked jaw trembles with a furious scream. I can see myself plunging down, I want so badly to indulge until my bones give way. I’d rather have the fabric’s friction burn my innards until I can sense nothing. Something has to move at my rhythm, something has to feel me making my way. Something has to thank me.
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>You know what? Let’s have some damn fun
